**SOL:** a zip file is hidden inside of Karuego.png. So we need to extract the zip from the image.
```bash
xxd Karuefo.png | grep IEND 
```
we will see ``001f6d20: f940 72ae 0000 0000 4945 4e44 ae42 6082  .@r.....IEND.B`.``.
It meens that the terminate byte of the png is 001f6d20.
Now check for the 001f6d30 byte
```bash
xxd Karuefo.png | grep 001f6d30 
```
The result was `001f6d30: 504b 0304 0a00 0000 0000 408a bd50 0000  PK........@..P..` and we can see there's `PK` in the line. `PK` are the initials of Phil Katz, the inventor of the zip file, and indicate that a zip file starts at that point.

As *0x001f6d30 = 2059568*
```bash
dd if=Karuego.png bs=1 skip=2059568 of=foo.zip
```
The zip file was locked, so I use `fcrackzip` and common password in rockyou.txt to brute search for the correct password.
```bash
fcrackzip -D -p rockyou.txt -u foo.zip
```
And the password of the zip file was *lafire*. Flag is in Demon.png
